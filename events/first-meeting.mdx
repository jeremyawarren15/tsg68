## It's Happening!

Thank you all for committing to this next year with Troop 68 of the Troops of Saint George. We are very excited to announce that we have officially chartered our troop with the Troops of Saint George!

We managed to bring together 6 fathers and 9 sons for our first year, so far!

## Upcoming Events

Please check on this website for any upcoming information regarding upcoming events or notifications. We will be rolling out a email newsletter soon.

## What you need to bring

If you can, please try to have your uniforms for this first meeting. We are hopeful that we will have the initial patches for the boys.

This is a pitch-in. We will have the main dish, please bring a side to contribute.

## Agenda

For security reasons, you will be given the address of our first meeting location and time by email when that has been determined.

Our first meeting will be pretty casual. We will mainly be introducing everyone and going over how the Troops of Saint George works. It may be helpful for you to skim through the [Officer's Manual](https://troopsofsaintgeorge.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/2020-09-28-TSG-Officers-Manual-2020-Ed.pdf) before the meeting, but it's not required.

We will also likely address the following:

- Forming a committee (Please consider whether you would like to be a committee member or not)
- How to get the older kids up to their proper rank
- Brainstorming meeting locations
- Getting available days to schedule regular meetings

If you have any questions please reach out to either Jeremy Warren or Micah Nantz. We can't wait to see you there!
